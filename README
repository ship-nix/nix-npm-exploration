# nix-npm-exploration

Exploration in figuring how to build a node/npm flake for both dev environment and nixos server configuration.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

# direnv

For the best experience, have direnv installed and hooked to your shell

# Build package locally

```bash
nix build
```

# Run development server

First enter development shell:

```bash
nix develop
```

Or, if you use `direnv`, you will already be inside your shell
